# Open Interest: full breakdown of all the possible combinations involving price, open interest delta (OI delta), and volume:


1. Rising Price + Positive OI Delta + High Green Volume:

Indicates: Strong long positions being opened.

Explanation: Buyers are driving the price higher, adding new long positions, and the green volume confirms that the majority of the trading activity is buying-driven.



2. Rising Price + Positive OI Delta + High Red Volume:

Indicates: There might be shorts getting squeezed or weak buyers.

Explanation: The price is rising, but red volume suggests sellers are active. Positive OI delta means contracts are being opened, possibly by short sellers who expect a reversal soon, or it could indicate weak long buyers facing pressure.



3. Falling Price + Positive OI Delta + High Red Volume:

Indicates: Short positions being opened.

Explanation: The price is dropping, red volume indicates heavy selling, and positive OI delta means new contracts are being opened, likely short positions driving the price lower.



4. Falling Price + Positive OI Delta + High Green Volume:

Indicates: Possible long positions being opened against the trend.

Explanation: Despite the falling price, green volume shows buyers stepping in. Positive OI delta suggests new contracts are being opened, but since the price is falling, it may indicate that some traders are betting on a reversal or that more sophisticated traders are positioning short while buyers are weak.



5. Rising Price + Negative OI Delta + High Green Volume:

Indicates: Short covering.

Explanation: The price is rising, green volume shows buyers are active, but OI delta is negative, indicating existing short positions are being closed. This buying pressure from short covering is driving the price upward.



6. Rising Price + Negative OI Delta + High Red Volume:

Indicates: Short covering with heavy selling.

Explanation: The price is rising, likely due to short covering, but the high red volume indicates thereâ€™s still significant selling pressure, possibly from those exiting long positions or from traders attempting to reverse the move.



7. Falling Price + Negative OI Delta + High Red Volume:

Indicates: Long liquidation.

Explanation: The price is dropping, red volume indicates heavy selling, and the negative OI delta shows that long positions are being closed, contributing to the downward pressure.



8. Falling Price + Negative OI Delta + High Green Volume:

Indicates: Long liquidation with some buying support.

Explanation: While the price is falling, green volume indicates that buyers are stepping in, but negative OI delta shows that existing long positions are being closed. This might be a signal of buyers trying to catch a bottom, but longs are still being liquidated.
