# Combining the Open Interest Delta (OI Delta) with the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicators

How to Combine OI Delta and MACD:

1. MACD Bullish Crossover + Positive OI Delta:

Indicates: A strong bullish signal.

Explanation: When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it shows that momentum is shifting upward. If this is coupled with positive OI delta, it indicates that traders are opening new long positions, reinforcing the bullish trend.


2. MACD Bullish Crossover + Negative OI Delta:

Indicates: A potential weak rally or short covering.

Explanation: The MACD bullish crossover suggests upward momentum, but if OI delta is negative, it might indicate that this price increase is driven by short covering (shorts closing their positions) rather than new buying interest. This could mean the rally lacks long-term strength.


3. MACD Bearish Crossover + Positive OI Delta:

Indicates: Strong bearish signal (shorts being added).

Explanation: When the MACD crosses below the signal line, it suggests downward momentum. If OI delta is positive at the same time, it likely indicates that traders are opening new short positions, strengthening the bearish trend.


4. MACD Bearish Crossover + Negative OI Delta:

Indicates: Weak downtrend or long liquidation.

Explanation: The MACD bearish crossover suggests downward momentum, but a negative OI delta indicates that existing long positions are being closed rather than new shorts being added. This might indicate the market is in a liquidation phase, but the downtrend could lose strength once long liquidation is exhausted.


5. MACD Divergence + Positive OI Delta:

Bullish Divergence + Positive OI Delta: This is a strong buy signal, indicating that new longs are entering the market, and MACD momentum is aligning with that.

Bearish Divergence + Positive OI Delta: This could indicate a false signal or short positions being opened while the MACD is showing potential weakening momentum.


6. MACD Divergence + Negative OI Delta:

Bullish Divergence + Negative OI Delta: Might indicate a short-covering rally, where shorts are closing, but there is limited new buying, causing price divergence.

Bearish Divergence + Negative OI Delta: Indicates that longs are being closed, and MACD may be signaling an exhaustion of the downtrend, possibly hinting at a reversal.


Strategy for Using Both Together:

Look for Confluence: If MACD and OI delta are aligned (e.g., bullish MACD crossover + positive OI delta), it strengthens the signal. Divergences between the two could indicate false moves or caution.

Confirm Trends: Use MACD to identify the trend direction and OI delta to confirm whether the trend is supported by new market participation.

Spot Reversals: A MACD divergence combined with OI delta (especially negative OI delta during a bullish divergence) could be an early signal of a trend reversal or weakening.
